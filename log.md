# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got started with fcc "Visualize Data with a Bar Chart" assignment.

**Thoughts:** Had quite some trouble getting started with D3. Had looked at D3 a couple of months back for the first time (seemed like I had forgotten most of it). Since did not have a link for the D3 project I was working on, I solved a problem on codewars. Including the link for that instead.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fcc "Visualize Data with a Bar Chart" assignment.

**Thoughts:** Had some trouble trying to fit the bars in the space. Till I did not divide gdp by a factor, all I got was a square of vertical lines becuase the graph was being cut off from the top. Took a lot of time in figuring out what was wrong. Need to add axis and tool-tip when we hover.
