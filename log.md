# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got started with fcc "Visualize Data with a Bar Chart" assignment.

**Thoughts:** Had quite some trouble getting started with D3. Had looked at D3 a couple of months back for the first time (seemed like I had forgotten most of it). Since did not have a link for the D3 project I was wrking on, I solved a problem on codewars. Including the link for that instead.

**Link to work:** [codewars] (https://github.com/gtalin/CodeWars)
